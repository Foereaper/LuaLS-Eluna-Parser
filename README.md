# LuaLS-Eluna-Parser
Parser to generate Eluna LSP definitions for LuaLS

# Generate definitions
I will post detailed instructions for definition generation later, but in short:

- Download a copy of the Eluna API documentation files, or generate a copy yourself using the document parser provided in the Eluna repo
- Run the parser on the documentation HTML files (example of this can be seen in the powershell script in this repo)
- Done!

# Installation
- Install VS Code, Neovim or any other LSP-enabled editor
- Follow the LuaLS installation instructions, found here https://luals.github.io/#vscode-install
- Configure your workspace/LSP to point to the location of your generated definitions
